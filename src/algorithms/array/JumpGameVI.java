/***
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k.

    You are initially standing at index 0. In one move, you can jump at most k steps forward without going outside the boundaries of the array. That is, you can jump from index i to any index in the range [i + 1, min(n - 1, i + k)] inclusive.
    
    You want to reach the last index of the array (index n - 1). Your score is the sum of all nums[j] for each index j you visited in the array.
    
    Return the maximum score you can get.
    
     
    
    Example 1:
    
    Input: nums = [1,-1,-2,4,-7,3], k = 2
    Output: 7
    Explanation: You can choose your jumps forming the subsequence [1,-1,4,3] (underlined above). The sum is 7.
    Example 2:
    
    Input: nums = [10,-5,-2,4,0,3], k = 3
    Output: 17
    Explanation: You can choose your jumps forming the subsequence [10,4,3] (underlined above). The sum is 17.
    Example 3:
    
    Input: nums = [1,-5,-20,4,-1,3,-6,-3], k = 2
    Output: 0
     
    
    Constraints:
    
    1 <= nums.length, k <= 10^5
    -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
